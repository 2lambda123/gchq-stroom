Stroom is a data processing, storage and analysis platform. It is scalable - just add more CPUs / servers for greater throughput. It is suitable for processing high volume data such as system logs, to provide valuable insights into IT performance and usage.

Stroom provides a number of powerful capabilities:

* **Data ingest.** Receive and store large volumes of data such as native format logs. Ingested data is always available in its raw form.
* **Data transformation pipelines.** Create sequences of XSL and text operations, in order to normalise or export data in any format. It is possible to enrich data using lookups and reference data.
* **Integrated transformation development.** Easily add new data formats and debug the transformations if they don't work as expected.
* **Scalable Search.** Create multiple indexes with different retention periods. These can be sharded across your cluster.
* **Dashboards.** Run queries against your indexes or statistics and view the results within custom visualisations.
* **Statistics.** Record counts or values of items over time, providing answers to questions such as "how many times has a specific machine provided data in the last hour/day/month?"

## Get Stroom

To run Stroom in docker do the following:

``` bash
# Download and extract the latest Stroom v6 stack
bash <(curl -s https://gchq.github.io/stroom-resources/v6.0/get_stroom.sh)
