# Stroom

This package allows you to run Stroom.

To run Stroom for the first time you should:
1. Check you're happy with the logging in `config.yml`
2. Update the environment variables in `stroom.conf`. E.g. configure the location of the MySQL databases.

You can use the `start.sh`/`stop.sh`/`restart.sh` scripts to manage the application.
