## [v7.2]

* Quoted strings in dashboard table expressions can now be expressed with single and double quotes. As part of this change apostrophes in text are no longer escaped with `''` but instead require a leading `\` before them if they are in a single quoted string. In many cases it is preferable to use double quotes if the string in question has an apostrophe.
