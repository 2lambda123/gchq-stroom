# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

* Issue **#732** : Added `host-address` and `host-name` XSLT functions.

* Issue **#338** : Added `splitAggregatedStreams` property to `StreamAppender`, `FileAppender` and `HDFSFileAppender` so that aggregated streams can be split into separate streams on output.

* Issue **#338** : Added `streamNo` path replacement variable for files to record the stream number within an aggregate.

* Added tests and fixed sorting of server tasks.

* Improved the way text input and output is buffered and recorded when stepping.

* The find and replace filter now resets the match count in between nested streams so that each stream is treated the same way, i.e. it can have the same number of text replacements.

## [v5.5.0-beta.9] - 2018-09-24

* Added multiple fixes and improvements to the find and replace filter including limited support of input/output recording when stepping.

## [v5.5.0-beta.8] - 2018-09-23

* Issue **#827** : Added `TextReplacementFilterReader` pipeline element.

* Issue **#736** : Added sorting to server tasks table.

* Inverted the behaviour of `disableQueryInfo` to now be `requireQueryInfo`.

* Issue **#596** : Rolling stream and file appenders can now roll on a cron schedule in addition to a frequency.

## [v5.5.0-beta.7] - 2018-09-18

* The accept button now enabled on splash screen.

## [v5.5.0-beta.6] - 2018-09-17

* Added additional event logging to stepping.

* An activity property with an id of `disableQueryInfo` can now be used to disable the query info popup on a per activity basis.

* Activity properties can now include the attributes `id`, `name`, `showInSelection` and `showInList` to determine their appearance and behaviour;

* Nested elements are now usable in the activity editor HTML.

* Record counts are now recorded on a per output stream basis even when splitting output streams.

* Splash presenter buttons are now always enabled.

* Fix background colour to white on activity pane.

## [v5.5.0-beta.5] - 2018-09-12

* Changed `splitWhenBiggerThan` property to `rollSize` and added the property to the rolling appenders for consistency.

* Issue **#838** : Fix bug where calculation of written and read bytes was being accounted for twice due to the use of Java internal `FilterInputStream` and `FilterOutputStream` behaviour. This was leading to files being split at half od the expected size. Replaced Java internal classes with our own `WrappedInputStream` and `WrappedOutputStream` code.

## [v5.5.0-beta.4] - 2018-09-11

* Issue **#837** : Fix bug to no longer try and record set activity events for null activities.

* Issue **#595** : Added stream appender and file appender property `splitWhenBiggerThan` to limit the size of output streams.

## [v5.5.0-beta.3] - 2018-09-10

* Now logs activity change correctly.

* Add support for checkbox and selection control types to activity descriptions.

* Issue **#833** : The global property edit dialog can now be made larger.

## [v5.5.0-beta.2] - 2018-09-07

* Fixed some issues in the activity manager.

## [v5.5.0-beta.1] - 2018-09-05

* Issue **#828** : Changed statistics store caches to 10 minute time to live so that they will definitely pick up new statistics store definitions after 10 minutes.

* Issue **#774** : Event logging now logs find stream criteria correctly so that feeds ids are included.

* Issue **#829** : Stroom now logs event id when viewing individual events.

* Added functionality to record actions against user defined activities.

* Added functionality to show a splash screen on login.

## [v5.4.6] - 2018-08-20

* Issue **#824** : Fix for replace method in PathCreator also found in stroom proxy.

* Issue **#820** : Fix updating index shards so that they are loaded, updated and saved under lock.

* Issue **#819** : Updated `stroom-expression` to v1.4.3 to fix violation of contract exception when sorting search results.

* Issue **#817** : Increased maximum number of concurrent stream processor tasks to 1000 per node.

## [v5.4.5] - 2018-07-13

* Issue **#697** : Fix for reference data sometimes failing to find the appropriate effective stream due to the incorrect use of the effective stream cache. It was incorrectly configured to use a time to idle (TTI) expiry rather than a time to live (TTL) expiry meaning that heavy use of the cache would prevent the cached effective streams being refreshed.

## [v5.4.4] - 2018-06-26

* Issue **#791** : Search completion signal is now only sent to the UI once all pending search result merges are completed.

* Issue **#795** : Import and export now works with appropriate application permissions. Read permission is required to export items and Create/Update permissions are required to import items depending on whether the update will create a new item or update an existing one.

## [v5.4.3] - 2018-06-08

* Issue **#783** : Reverted code that ignored duplicate selection to fix double click in tables.

## [v5.4.2] - 2018-06-05

## [v5.4.1] - 2018-05-25

* Issue **#778** : Fix for text selection on tooltips etc in the latest version of Chrome.

## [v5.4.0] - 2018-05-23

## [v5.2.4] - 2018-04-18

* Issue **#735** : Change the format-date xslt function to parse dates in a case insensitive way.

## [v5.2.3] - 2018-03-27

* Issue **#703** : Removed logging of InterruptedException stack trace on SQL stat queries, improved concurrency code.

* Issue **#697** : Improved XSLT `Lookup` trace messages.

## [v5.2.2] - 2018-03-26

* Issue **#697** : Added a feature to trace XSLT `Lookup` attempts so that reference data lookups can be debugged.

* Issue **#702** : Fix for hanging search extraction tasks

## [v5.2.1] - 2018-03-23

* Issue **#701** : The search `maxDocIdQueueSize` is now 1000 by default.

* Issue **#700** : The format-date XSLT function now defaults years, months and days to the stream receipt time regardless of whether the input date pattern specifies them.

* Issue **#657** : Change SQL Stats query code to process/transform the data as it comes back from the database rather than holding the full resultset before processing. This will reduce memory overhead and improve performance.

* Issue **#634** : Remove excessive thread sleeping in index shard searching. Sleeps were causing a significant percentage of inactivity and increasing memory use as data backed up. Add more logging and logging of durations of chunks of code. Add an integration test for testing index searching for large data volumes.

## [v5.2.0] - 2018-02-25

* Issue **#659** : Made format-date XSLT function default year if none specified to the year the data was received unless this would make the date later then the received time in which case a year is subtracted.

* Issue **#658** : Added a hashing function for XSLT translations.

## [v5.1.0] - 2018-02-07

* Issue **#523** : Changed permission behaviours for copy and move to support `None`, `Source`, `Destination` and `Combined` behaviours. Creating new items now allows for `None` and `Destination` permission behaviours. Also imported items now receive permissions from the destination folder. Event logging now indicates the permission behaviour used during copy, move and create operations.

## [v5.1-beta.16] - 2018-02-06

* Issue **#623** : Fixed issue where items were being added to sublist causing a stack overflow exception during data retention processing.

## [v5.1-beta.15] - 2018-02-05

* Issue **#608** : Fixed stream grep and stream dump tools and added tests to ensure continued operation.

* Issue **#603** : Changed property description from `tags` to `XML elements` in `BadTextXMLFilterReader`.

## [v5.1-beta.14] - 2018-02-04

* Issue **#600** : Added debug to help diagnose cause of missing index shards in shard list.

* Issue **#611** : Changed properties to be defined in code rather than Spring XML.

* Issue **#605** : Added a cache for retrieving user by name to reduce DB use when pushing users for each task.

* Issue **#610** : Added `USE INDEX (PRIMARY)` hint to data retention select SQL to improve performance.

* Issue **#607** : Multiple improvements to the code to ensure DB connections, prepared statements, result sets etc use try-with-resources constructs wherever possible to ensure no DB resources are leaked. Also all connections obtained from a data source are now returned appropriately so that connections from pools are reused.

* Issue **#602** : Changed the data retention rule table column order.

* Issue **#606** : Added more stroom properties to tune the c3P0 connection pool. The properties are prefixed by `stroom.db.connectionPool` and `stroom.statistics.sql.db.connectionPool`.

* Issue **#601** : Fixed NPE generated during index shard retention process that was caused by a shard being deleted from the DB at the same time as the index shard retention job running.

## [v5.1-beta.13] - 2018-01-30

* Issue **#591** : Made the query info popup more configurable with a title, validation regex etc. The popup will now only be displayed when enabled and when a manual user action takes place, e.g. clicking a search button or running a parameterised execution with one or more queries.

## [v5.1-beta.12] - 2018-01-30

* Issue **#150** : Added a property to optionally require specification of search purpose.

## [v5.1-beta.11] - 2018-01-29

* Issue **#573** : Fixed viewing folders with no permitted underlying feeds. It now correctly shows blank data screen, rather than System/Data.

* Issue **#150** : Added a feature to optionally require specification of search purpose.

* Issue **#572** : Added a feature to allow easy download of dictionary contents as a text file.

* Issue **#559** : Changed CSS to allow table text selection in newer browsers.

* Issue **#574** : Fixed SQL debug trace output.

* Issue **#574** : Fixed SQL UNION code that was resulting in missing streams in the data browser when paging.

* Issue **#590** : Improved data browser performance by using a local cache to remember feeds, stream types, processors, pipelines etc while decorating streams.

## [v5.1-beta.10] - 2018-01-26

* Issue **#567** : Changed `parseUri` to be `parse-uri` to keep it consistently named with respect to other XSLT functions. The old name `parseUri` still works but is deprecated and will be removed in a later version.

* Issue **#567** : The XSLT function `parse-uri` now correctly returns a `schemeSpecificPart` element rather than the incorrectly named `schemeSpecificPort`.

* Issue **#567** : The dashboard expression function `extractSchemeSpecificPortFromUri` has now been corrected to be called `extractSchemeSpecificPartFromUri`.

* Issue **#567** : The missing dashboard expression function `extractQueryFromUri` has been added.

* Issue **#571** : Streams are now updated to have a status of deleted in batches using native SQL and prepared statements rather than using the stream store.

## [v5.1-beta.9] - 2018-01-16

* Issue **#560** : Replaced instances of `Files.walk()` with `Files.walkFileTree()`. `Files.walk()` throws errors if any files are deleted or are not accessible during the walk operation. This is a major issue with the Java design for walking files using Java 8 streams. To avoid this issue `Files.walkFileTree()` has now been used in place of `Files.walk()`.

## [v5.1-beta.8] - 2018-01-12

* Issue **#550** : Fix for info message output for data retention.

* Issue **#551** : Improved server task detail for data retention job.

* Issue **#541** : Changed stream retention job descriptions.

* Issue **#553** : The data retention job now terminates if requested to do so and also tracks progress in a local temp file so a nodes progress will survive application restarts.

## [v5.1-beta.7] - 2018-01-10

* Change docker image to use openjdk:8u151-jre-alpine as a base

* Issue **#539** : Fix issue of statistic search failing after it is imported

* Issue **#547** : Data retention processing is now performed in batches (size determined by `stroom.stream.deleteBatchSize`). This change should reduce the memory required to process the data retention job.

## [v5.1-beta.6] - 2018-01-08

* Issue **#541** : Marked old stream retention job as deprecated in description.

* Issue **#542** : Fix for lazy hibernate object initialisation when stepping cooked data.

## [v5.1-beta.5] - 2018-01-04

* Issue **#540** : Improve description text for stroom.statistics.sql.maxProcessingAge property

* Issue **#538** : Lists of items such as users or user groups were sometimes not being converted into result pages correctly, this is now fixed.

* Issue **#537** : Users without `Manage Policies` permission can now view streams.

* Issue **#522** : Selection of data retention rules now remains when moving rules up or down.

* Issue **#411** : When data retention rules are disabled they are now shown greyed out to indicate this.

* Issue **#536** : Fix for missing visualisation icons.

* Issue **#368** : Fixed hidden job type button on job node list screen when a long cron pattern is used.

## [v5.1-beta.4] - 2017-12-20

* Issue **#521** : Fix for the job list screen to correct the help URL.

* Issue **#526** : Fix for XSLT functions that should return optional results but were being forced to return a single value.

* Issue **#527** : Fix for XSLT error reporting. All downstream errors were being reported as XSLT module errors and were
 hiding the underlying exception.

## [v5.1-beta.3] - 2017-12-18

* Issue **#501** : Improve the database teardown process in integration tests to speed up builds.

* Issue **#511** : Fix NPE thrown during pipeline stepping by downstream XSLT.

* Issue **#521** : Fix for the job list screen to use the help URL system property for displaying context sensitive help.

* Issue **#524** : Remove dependency on stroom-proxy:stroom-proxy-repo and replaced with duplicated code from stroom-proxy-repo (commit b981e1e)

## [v5.1-beta.2] - 2017-12-12

* Issue **#511** : Fix for XSLT functions to allow null return values where a value cannot be returned due to an error etc.

## [v5.1-beta.1] - 2017-12-11

* Issue **#508** : Fix directory creation for index shards.

* Issue **#492** : Task producers were still not being marked as complete on termination which meant that the parent cluster task was not completing. This has now been fixed.

* Issue **#497** : DB connections obtained from the data source are now released back to the pool after use.

* Issue **#492** : Task producers were not being marked as complete on termination which meant that the parent cluster task was not completing. This has now been fixed.

* Issue **#497** : Change stream task creation to use straight JDBC rather than hibernate for inserts and use a configurable batch size (stroom.databaseMultiInsertMaxBatchSize) for the inserts.

* Issue **#502** : The task executor was not responding to shutdown and was therefore preventing the app from stopping gracefully.

* Issue **#476** : Stepping with dynamic XSLT or text converter properties now correctly falls back to the specified entity if a match cannot be found by name.

* Issue **#498** : The UI was adding more than one link between 'Source' and 'Parser' elements, this is now fixed.

* Issue **#492** : Search tasks were waiting for part of the data extraction task to run which was not checking for termination. The code for this has been changed and should now terminate when required.

* Issue **#494** : Fix problem of proxy aggregation never stopping if more files exist

* Issue **#490** : Fix errors in proxy aggregation due to a bounded thread pool size

* Issue **#484** : Remove custom finalize() methods to reduce memory overhead

* Issue **#475** : Fix memory leak of java.io.File references when proxy aggregation runs

* Issue **#470** : You can now correctly add destinations directly to the pipeline 'Source' element to enable raw streaming.

* Issue **#487** : Search result list trimming was throwing an illegal argument exception `Comparison method violates its general contract`, this should now be fixed.

* Issue **#488** : Permissions are now elevated to 'Use' for the purposes of reporting the data source being queried.

* Migrated to ehcache 3.4.0 to add options for off-heap and disk based caching to reduce memory overhead.

* Caches of pooled items no longer use Apache Commons Pool.

* Issue **#401** : Reference data was being cached per user to ensure a user centric view of reference data was being used. This required more memory so now reference data is built in the context of the internal processing user and then filtered during processing by user access to streams.

* The effective stream cache now holds 1000 items.

* Reduced the amount of cached reference data to 100 streams.

* Reduced the number of active queries to 100.

* Removed Ehcache and switched to Guava cache.

* Issue **#477** : Additional changes to ensure search sub tasks use threads fairly between multiple searches.

* Issue **#477** : Additional changes to ensure search sub tasks use threads fairly between multiple searches.

* Issue **#477** : Search sub tasks are now correctly linked to their parent task and can therefore be terminated by terminating parent tasks.

* Issue **#425** : Changed string replacement in pipeline migration code to use a literal match

* Issue **#469** : Add Heap Histogram internal statistics for memory use monitoring

* Issue **#463** : Made further improvements to the index shard writer cache to improve performance.

* Issue **#448** : Some search related tasks never seem to complete, presumably because an error is thrown at some point and so their callbacks do not get called normally. This fix changes the way task completion is recorded so that it isn't dependant on the callbacks being called correctly.

* Issue **#464** : When a user resets a password, the password now has an expiry date set in the future determined by the password expiry policy. Password that are reset by email still expire immediately as expected.

* Issue **#462** : Permission exceptions now carry details of the user that the exception applies to. This change allows error logging to record the user id in the message where appropriate.

* Issue **#463** : Many index shards are being corrupted which may be caused by insufficient locking of the shard writers and readers. This fix changes the locking mechanism to use the file system.

* Issue **#451** : Data paging was allowing the user to jump beyond the end of a stream whereby just the XML root elements were displayed. This is now fixed by adding a constraint to the page offset so that the user cannot jump beyond the last record. Because data paging assumes that segmented streams have a header and footer, text streams now include segments after a header and before a footer, even if neither are added, so that paging always works correctly regardless of the presence of a header or footer.

* Issue **#461** : The stream attributes on the filter dialog were not sorted alphabetically, they now are.

* Issue **#460** : In some instances error streams did not always have stream attributes added to them for fatal errors. This mainly occurred in instances where processing failed early on during pipeline creation. An error was recorded but stream attributes were not added to the meta data for the error stream. Processing now ensures that stream attributes are recorded for all error cases.

* Issue **#442** : Remove 'Old Internal Statistics' folder, improve import exception handling

* Issue **#457** : Add check to import to prevent duplicate root level entities

* Issue **#444** : Fix for segment markers when writing text to StreamAppender.

* Issue **#447** : Fix for AsyncSearchTask not being displayed as a child of EventSearchTask in the server tasks view.

* Issue **#421** : FileAppender now causes fatal error where no output path set.

* Issue **#427** : Pipelines with no source element will now only treat a single parser element as being a root element for backwards compatibility.

* Issue **#420** : Pipelines were producing errors in the UI when elements were deleted but still had properties set on them. The pipeline validator was attempting to set and validate properties for unknown elements. The validator now ignores properties and links to elements that are undeclared.

* Issue **#420** : The pipeline model now removes all properties and links for deleted elements on save.

* Issue **#458** : Only event searches should populate the `searchId`. Now `searchId` is only populated when a stream processor task is created by an event search as only event searches extract specific records from the source stream.

* Issue **#437** : The event log now includes source in move events.

* Issue **#419** : Fix multiple xml processing instructions appearing in output.

* Issue **#446** : Fix for deadlock on rolling appenders.

* Issue **#444** : Fix segment markers on RollingStreamAppender.

* Issue **#426** : Fix for incorrect processor filters. Old processor filters reference `systemGroupIdSet` rather than `folderIdSet`. The new migration updates them accordingly.

* Issue **#429** : Fix to remove `usePool` parser parameter.

* Issue **#439** : Fix for caches where elements were not eagerly evicted.

* Issue **#424** : Fix for cluster ping error display.

* Issue **#441** : Fix to ensure correct names are shown in pipeline properties.

* Issue **#433** : Fixed slow stream queries caused by feed permission restrictions.

* Issue **#385** : Individual index shards can now be deleted without deleting all shards.

* Issue **#391** : Users needed `Manage Processors` permission to initiate pipeline stepping. This is no longer required as the 'best fit' pipeline is now discovered as the internal processing user.

* Issue **#392** : Inherited pipelines now only require 'Use' permission to be used instead of requiring 'Read' permission.

* Issue **#394** : Pipeline stepping will now show errors with an alert popup.

* Issue **#396** : All queries associated with a dashboard should now be correctly deleted when a dashboard is deleted.

* Issue **#393** : All caches now cache items within the context of the current user so that different users do not have the possibility of having problems caused by others users not having read permissions on items.

* Issue **#358** : Schemas are now selected from a subset matching the criteria set on SchemaFilter by the user.

* Issue **#369** : Translation stepping wasn't showing any errors during stepping if a schema had an error in it.

* Issue **#364** : Switched index writer lock factory to a SingleInstanceLockFactory as index shards are accessed by a single process.

* Issue **#363** : IndexShardWriterCacheImpl now closes and flushes writers using an executor provided by the TaskManager. Writers are now also closed in LRU order when sweeping up writers that exceed TTL and TTI constraints.

* Issue **#361** : Information has been added to threads executing index writer and index searcher maintenance tasks.

* Issue **#356** : Changed the way index shard writers are cached to improve indexing performance and reduce blocking.

* Issue **#353** : Reduced expected error logging to debug.

* Issue **#354** : Changed the way search index shard readers get references to open writers so that any attempt to get an open writer will not cause, or have to wait for, a writer to close.

* Issue **#351** : Fixed ehcache item eviction issue caused by ehcache internally using a deprecated API.

* Issue **#347** : Added a 'Source' node to pipelines to establish a proper root for a pipeline rather than an assumed one based on elements with no parent.

* Issue **#350** : Removed 'Advanced Mode' from pipeline structure editor as it is no longer very useful.

* Issue **#349** : Improved index searcher cache to ensure searchers are not affected by writers closing.

* Issue **#342** : Changed the way indexing is performed to ensure index readers reference open writers correctly.

* Issue **#346** : Improved multi depth config content import.

* Issue **#328** : You can now delete corrupt shards from the UI.

* Issue **#343** : Fixed login expiry issue.

* Issue **#345** : Allowed for multi depth config content import.

* Issue **#341** : Fixed arg in SQL.

* Issue **#340** : Fixed headless and corresponding test.

* Issue **#333** : Fixed event-logging version in build.

* Issue **#334** : Improved entity sorting SQL and separated generation of SQL and HQL to help avoid future issues.

* Issue **#335** : Improved user management

* Issue **#337** : Added certificate auth option to export servlet and disabled the export config feature by default.

* Issue **#337** : Added basic auth option to export servlet to complement cert based auth.

* Issue **#332** : The index shard searcher cache now makes sure to get the current writer needed for the current searcher on open.

* Issue **#322** : The index cache and other caching beans should now throw exceptions on `get` that were generated during the creation of cached items.

* Issue **#348** : Fixed new menu icons.

* Issue **#515** : Fix handling of errors that occur before search starts sending.

* Issue **#506** : In v5 dashboard table filters were enhanced to allow parameters to be used in include/exclude filters. The implementation included the use of `\` to escape `$` characters that were not to be considered part of a parameter reference. This change resulted in regular expressions requiring `\` being escaped with additional `\` characters. This escaping has now been removed and instead only `$` chars before `{` chars need escaping when necessary with double `$$` chars, e.g. use `$${something` if you actually want `${something` not to be replaced with a parameter.

* Issue **#505** : Fix the property UI so all edited value whitespace is trimmed

* Issue **#513** : Now only actively executing tasks are visible as server tasks

* Issue **#483** : When running stream retention jobs the transactions are now set to REQUIRE_NEW to hopefully ensure that the job is done in small batches rather than a larger transaction spanning multiple changes.

## [v5.1-alpha.2] - 2017-06-22

* Issue **#325** : Query history is now cleaned with a separate job. Also query history is only recorded for manual querying, i.e. not when query is automated (on open or auto refresh). Queries are now recorded on a dashboard + query component basis and do not apply across multiple query components in a dashboard.

* Issue **#323** : Fixed an issue where parser elements were not being returned as 'processors' correctly when downstream of a reader.

* Issue **#322** : Index should now provide a more helpful message when an attempt is made to index data and no volumes have been assigned to an index.

* Issue **#316** : Search history is now only stored on initial query when using automated queries or when a user runs a query manually. Search history is also automatically purged to keep either a specified number of items defined by `stroom.query.history.itemsRetention` (default 100) or for a number of days specified by `stroom.query.history.daysRetention` (default 365).

* Issue **#317** : Users now need update permission on an index plus 'Manage Index Shards' permission to flush or close index shards. In addition to this a user needs delete permission to delete index shards.

* Issue **#319** : SaveAs now fetches the parent folder correctly so that users can copy items if they have permission to do so.

* Issue **#311** : Fixed request for `Pipeline` in `meta` XSLT function. Errors are now dealt with correctly so that the XSLT will not fail due to missing meta data.

* Issue **#313** : Fixed case of `xmlVersion` property on `InvalidXMLCharFilterReader`.

* Issue **#314** : Improved description of `tags` property in `BadTextXMLFilterReader`.

* Issue **#203** : Initial release of the new data receipt policy functionality.

## [v5.1-alpha.1] - 2017-06-07

* Issue **#307** : Made some changes to avoid potential NPE caused by session serialisation.

* Issue **#306** : Added a stroom `meta` XSLT function. The XSLT function now exposes `Feed`, `StreamType`, `CreatedTime`, `EffectiveTime` and `Pipeline` meta attributes from the currently processing stream in addition to any other meta data that might apply. To access these meta data attributes of the current stream use `stroom:meta('StreamType')` etc. The `feed-attribute` function is now an alias for the `meta` function and should be considered to be deprecated.

* Issue **#303** : The stream delete job now uses cron in preference to a frequency.

* Issue **#152** : Changed the way indexing is performed so that a single indexer object is now responsible for indexing documents and adding them to the appropriate shard.

* Issue **#179** : Updated Saxon-HE to version 9.7.0-18 and added XSLTFilter option to `usePool` to see if caching might be responsible for issue.

* Issue **#288** : Made further changes to ensure that the IndexShardWriterCache doesn't try to reuse an index shard that has failed when adding any documents.

* Issue **#295** : Made the help URL absolute and not relative.

* Issue **#293** : Attempt to fix mismatch document count error being reported when index shards are opened.

* Issue **#292** : Fixed locking for rolling stream appender.

* Issue **#292** : Rolling stream output is no longer associated with a task, processor or pipeline to avoid future processing tasks from deleting rolling streams by thinking they are superseded.

* Issue **#292** : Data that we expect to be unavailable, e.g. locked and deleted streams, will no longer log exceptions when a user tries to view it and will instead return an appropriate message to the user in place of the data.

* Issue **#288** : The error condition 'Expected a new writer but got the same one back!!!' should no longer be encountered as the root cause should now be fixed. The original check has been reinstated so that processing will terminate if we do encounter this problem.

* Issue **#295** : Fixed the help property so that it can now be configured.

* Issue **#296** : Removed 'New' and 'Delete' buttons from the global property dialog.

* Issue **#279** : Fixed NPE thrown during proxy aggregation.

* Issue **#294** : Changing stream task status now tries multiple times to attempt to avoid a hibernate LockAcquisitionException.

* Issue **#287** : XSLT not found warnings property description now defaults to false.

* Issue **#261** : The save button is now only enabled when a dashboard or other item is made dirty and it is not read only.

* Issue **#286** : Dashboards now correctly save the selected tab when a tab is selected via the popup tab selector (visible when tabs are collapsed).

* Issue **#289** : Changed Log4J configuration to suppress logging from Hibernate SqlExceptionHandler for expected exceptions like constraint violations.

* Issue **#288** : Changed 'Expected a new writer...' fatal error to warning as the condition in question might be acceptable.

* Issue **#285** : Attempted fix for GWT RPC serialisation issue.

* Issue **#283** : Statistics for the stream task queue are now captured even if the size is zero.

* Issue **#226** : Fixed issue where querying an index failed with "User does not have the required permission (Manage Users)" message.

* Issue **#281** : Made further changes to cope with Files.list() and Files.walk() returning streams that should be closed with 'try with resources' construct.

* Issue **#224** : Removing an element from the pipeline structure now removes all child elements too.

* Issue **#282** : Users can now upload data with just 'Data - View' and 'Data - Import' application permissions, plus read permission on the appropriate feed.

* Issue **#199** : The explorer now scrolls selected items into view.

* Issue **#280** : Fixed 'No user is currently authenticated' issue when viewing jobs and nodes.

* Issue **#278** : The date picker now hides once you select a date.

* Issue **#281** : Directory streams etc are now auto closed to prevent systems running out of file handles.

* Issue **#263** : The explorer tree now allows you to collapse the root 'System' node after it is first displayed.

* Issue **#266** : The explorer tree now resets (clears and collapses all previously open nodes) and shows the currently selected item every time an explorer drop down in opened.

* Issue **#233** : Users now only see streams if they are administrators or have 'Data - View' permission. Non administrators will only see data that they have 'read' permission on for the associated feed and 'use' permission on for the associated pipeline if there is one.

* Issue **#265** : The stream filter now orders stream attributes alphabetically.

* Issue **#270** : Fixed security issue where null users were being treated as INTERNAL users.

* Issue **#270** : Improved security by pushing user tokens rather than just user names so that internal system (processing) users are clearly identifiable by the security system and cannot be spoofed by regular user accounts.

* Issue **#269** : When users are prevented from logging in with 'preventLogin' their failed login count is no longer incremented.

* Issue **#267** : The login page now shows the maintenance message.

* Issue **#276** : Session list now shows session user ids correctly.

* Issue **#201** : The permissions menu item is no longer available on the root 'System' folder.

* Issue **#176** : Improved performance of the explorer tree by increasing the size of the document permissions cache to 1M items and changing the eviction policy from LRU to LFU.

* Issue **#176** : Added an optimisation to the explorer tree that prevents the need for a server call when collapsing tree nodes.

* Issue **#273** : Removed an unnecessary script from the build.

* Issue **#277** : Fixed a layout issue that was causing the feed section of the processor filter popup to take up too much room.

* Issue **#274** : The editor pane was only returning the current user edited text when attached to the DOM which meant changes to text were ignored if an editor pane was not visible when save was pressed. This has now been fixed so that the current content of an editor pane is always returned even when it is in a detached state.

* Issue **#264** : Added created by/on and updated by/on info to pipeline stream processor info tooltips.

* Issue **#222** : Explorer items now auto expand when a quick filter is used.

* Issue **#205** : File permissions in distribution have now been changed to `0750` for directories and shell scripts and `0640` for all other files.

* Issue **#240** : Separate application permissions are now required to manage DB tables and tasks.

* Issue **#210** : The statistics tables are now listed in the database tables monitoring pane.

* Issue **#249** : Removed spaces between values and units.

* Issue **#237** : Users without 'Download Search Results' permission will no longer see the download button on the table component in a dashboard.

* Issue **#232** : Users can now inherit from pipelines that they have 'use' permissions on.

* Issue **#191** : Max stream size was not being treated as IEC value, e.g. Mebibytes etc.

* Issue **#235** : Users can now only view the processor filters that they have created if they have 'Manage Processors' permission unless they are an administrator in which case they will see all filters. Users without the 'Manage Processors' permission who are also not administrators will see no processor filters in the UI. Users with 'Manage Processors' permission who are not administrators will be able to update their own processor filters if they have 'update' permission on the associated pipeline. Administrators are able to update all processor filters.

* Issue **#212** : Changes made to text in any editor including those made with cut and paste are now correctly handled so that altered content is now saved.

* Issue **#247** : The editor pane now attempts to maintain the scroll position when formatting content.

* Issue **#251** : Volume and memory statistics are now recorded in bytes and not MiB.

* Issue **#243** : The error marker pane should now discover and display all error types even if they are preceded by over 1000 warnings.

* Issue **#254** : Fixed search result download.

* Issue **#209** : Statistics are now queryable in a dashboard if a user has 'use' permissions on a statistic.

* Issue **#255** : Fixed issue where error indicators were not being shown in the schema validator pane because the text needed to be formatted so that it spanned multiple lines before attempting to add annotations.

* Issue **#257** : The dashboard text pane now provides padding at the top to allow for tabs and controls.

* Issue **#174** : Index shard checking is now done asynchronously during startup to reduce startup time.

* Issue **#225** : Fixed NPE that was caused by processing instruction SAX events unexpectedly being fired by Xerces before start document events. This looks like it might be a bug in Xerces but the code now copes with the unexpected processing instruction event anyway.

* Issue **#230** : The maintenance message can now be set with the property 'stroom.maintenance.message' and the message now appears as a banner at the top of the screen rather than an annoying popup. Non admin users can also be prevented from logging on to the system by setting the 'stroom.maintenance.preventLogin' property to 'true'.

* Issue **#155** : Changed password values to be obfuscated in the UI as 20 asterisks regardless of length.

* Issue **#188** : All of the writers in a pipeline now display IO in the UI when stepping.

* Issue **#208** : Schema filter validation errors are now shown on the output pane during stepping.

* Issue **#211** : Turned off print margins in all editors.

* Issue **#200** : The stepping presenter now resizes the top pane to fit the tree structure even if it is several elements high.

* Issue **#168** : Code and IO is now loaded lazily into the element presenter panes during stepping which prevents the scrollbar in the editors being in the wrong position.

* Issue **#219** : Changed async dispatch code to work with new lambda classes rather than callbacks.

* Issue **#205** : File permissions in distribution have now been changed to `0750` for directories and shell scripts and `0640` for all other files.

* Issue **#221** : Fixed issue where `*.zip.bad` files were being picked up for proxy aggregation.

* Issue **#242** : Improved the way properties are injected into some areas of the code to fix an issue where 'stroom.maxStreamSize' and other properties were not being set.

* Issue **#241** : XMLFilter now ignores the XSLT name pattern if an empty string is supplied.

* Issue **#236** : 'Manage Cache Permission' has been changed to 'Manage Cache'.

* Issue **#219** : Made further changes to use lambda expressions where possible to simplify code.

* Issue **#231** : Changed the way internal statistics are created so that multiple facets of a statistic, e.g. Free & Used Memory, are combined into a single statistic to allow combined visualisation.

* Issue **#172** : Further improvement to dashboard L&F.

* Issue **#194** : Fixed missing Roboto fonts.

* Issue **#195** : Improved font weights and removed underlines from link tabs.

* Issue **#196** : Reordered fields on stream, relative stream, volume and server task tables.

* Issue **#182** : Changed the way dates and times are parsed and formatted and improved the datebox control L&F.

* Issue **#198** : Renamed 'INTERNAL_PROCESSING_USER' to 'INTERNAL'.

* Issue **#154** : Active tasks are now sortable by processor filter priority.

* Issue **#204** : Pipeline processor statistics now include 'Node' as a tag.

* Issue **#170** : Changed import/export to delegate import/export responsibility to individual services. Import/export now only works with items that have valid UUIDs specified.

* Issue **#164** : Reduced caching to ensure tree items appear as soon as they are added.

* Issue **#177** : Removed 'Meta Data-Bytes Received' statistic as it was a duplicate.

* Issue **#152** : Changed the way index shard creation is locked so that only a single shard should be fetched from the cache with a given shard key at any one time.

* Issue **#189** : You now have to click within a checkbox to select it within a table rather than just clicking the cell the checkbox is in.

* Issue **#186** : Data is no longer artificially wrapped with the insertion of new lines server side. Instead the client now receives the data and an option to soft wrap lines has been added to the UI.

* Issue **#167** : Fixed formatting of JavaScript and JSON.

* Issue **#175** : Fixed visibility of items by inferred permissions.

* Issue **#178** : Added new properties and corresponding configuration to connect and create a separate SQL statistics DB.

* Issue **#172** : Improved dashboard L&F.

* Issue **#169** : Improved L&F of tables to make better use of screen real estate.

* Issue **#191** : Mebibytes (multiples of 1024) etc are now used as standard throughout the application for both memory and disk sizes and have single letter suffixes (B, K, M, G, T).

* Issue **#173** : Fixed the way XML formatter deals with spaces in attribute values.

* Issue **#151** : Fixed meta data statistics. 'metaDataStatistics' bean was declared as an interface and not a class.

* Issue **#158** : Added a new global property 'stroom.proxy.zipFilenameDelimiter' to enable Stroom proxy repositories to be processed that have a custom file name pattern.

* Issue **#153** : Clicking tick boxes and other cell components in tables no longer requires the row to be selected first.

* Issue **#148** : The stream browsing UI no longer throws an error when attempting to clear markers from the error markers pane.

* Issue **#160** : Stream processing tasks are now created within the security context of the user that created the associated stream processor filter.

* Issue **#157** : Data is now formatted by the editor automatically on display.

* Issue **#144** : Old processing output will now be deleted when content is reprocessed even if the new processing task does not produce output.

* Issue **#159** : Fixed NPE thrown during import.

* Issue **#166** : Fixed NPE thrown when searching statistics.

* Issue **#165** : Dashboards now add a query and result table from a template by default on creation. This was broken when adding permission inheritance to documents.

* Issue **#163** : Imported the Roboto Mono font to ensure consistency of the editor across platforms.

* Issue **#143** : Stroom now logs progress information about closing index shard writers during shutdown.

* Issue **#140** : Replaced code editor to improve UI performance and add additional code formatting & styling options.

* Issue **#146** : Object pool should no longer throw an error when abandoned objects are returned to the pool.

* Issue **#142** : Changed the way permissions are cached so that changes to permissions provide immediate access to documents.

* Issue **#123** : Changed the way entity service result caching works so that the underlying entity manager is cached instead of individual services. This allows entity result caching to be performed while still applying user permissions to cached results.

* Issue **#156** : Attempts to open items that that user does not have permission to open no longer show an error and spin the progress indicator forever, instead the item will just not open.

* Issue **#141** : Improved log output during entity reference migration and fixed statistic data source reference migration.

* Issue **#127** : Entity reference replacement should now work with references to 'StatisticsDataSource'.

* Issue **#125** : Fixed display of active tasks which was broken by changes to the task summary table selection model.

* Issue **#121** : Fixed cache clearing.

* Issue **#122** : Improved the look of the cache screen.

* Issue **#106** : Disabled users and groups are now displayed with greyed out icon in the UI.

* Issue **#132** : The explorer tree is now cleared on login so that users with different permissions do not see the previous users items.

* Issue **#128** : Improved error handling during login.

* Issue **#130** : Users with no permissions are no longer able to open folders including the root System folder to attempt data browsing.

* Issue **#120** : Entity chooser now treats 'None' as a special root level explorer node so that it can be selected in the same way as other nodes, e.g. visibly selected and responsive to double click.

* Issue **#129** : Fixed NPE.

* Issue **#119** : User permissions dialog now clears permissions when a user or group is deleted.

* Issue **#115** : User permissions on documents can now be inherited from parent folders on create, copy and move.

* Issue **#109** : Added packetSize="65536" property to AJP connector in server.xml template.

* Issue **#100** : Various list of items in stroom now allow multi selection for add/remove purposes.

* Issue **#112** : Removed 'pool' monitoring screen as all pools are now caches of one form or another.

* Issue **#105** : Users were not seeing 'New' menu for folders that they had some create child doc permissions for. This was due to DocumentType not implementing equals() and is now fixed.

* Issue **#111** : Fixed query favourites and history.

* Issue **#91** : Only CombinedParser was allowing code to be injected during stepping. Now DSParser and XMLFragmentParser support code injection during stepping.

* Issue **#107** : The UI now only shows new pipeline element items on the 'Add' menu that are allowed children of the selected element.

* Issue **#113** : User names are now validated against a regex specified by the 'stroom.security.userNamePattern' property.

* Issue **#116** : Rename is now only possible when a single explorer item is selected.

* Issue **#114** : Fixed selection manager so that the explorer tree does not select items when a node expander is clicked.

* Issue **#65** : Selection lists are now limited to 300px tall and show scrollbars if needed.

* Issue **#50** : Defaults table result fields to use local time without outputting the timezone.

* Issue **#15** : You can now express time zones in dashboard query expressions or just omit a time zone to use the locale of the browser.

* Issue **#49** : Dynamic XSLT selection now works with pipeline stepping.

* Issue **#63** : Entity selection control now shows current entity name even if it has changed since referencing entity was last saved.

* Issue **#70** : You can now select multiple explorer rows with ctrl and shift key modifiers and perform bulk actions such as copy, move, rename and delete.

* Issue **#85** : findDelete() no longer tries to add ORDER BY condition on UPDATE SQL when deleting streams.

* Issue **#89** : Warnings should now be present in processing logs for reference data lookups that don't specify feed or stream type. This was previously throwing a NullPointerException.

* Issue **#90** : Fixed entity selection dialog used outside of drop down selection control.

* Issue **#88** : Pipeline reference edit dialog now correctly selects the current stream type.

* Issue **#77** : Default index volume creation now sets stream status to INACTIVE rather than CLOSED and stream volume creation sets index status to INACTIVE rather than CLOSED.

* Issue **#93** : Fixed code so that the 'Item' menu is now visible.

* Issue **#97** : Index shard partition date range creation has been improved.

* Issue **#94** : Statistics searches now ignore expression terms with null or empty values so that the use of substitution parameters can be optional.

* Issue **#87** : Fixed explorer scrolling to the top by disabling keyboard selection.

* Issue **#104** : 'Query' no longer appears as an item that a user can allow 'create' on for permissions within a folder.

* Issue **#103** : Added 10 years as a supported data retention age.

* Issue **#86** : The stream delete button is now re-enabled when new items are selected for deletion.

* Issue **#81** : No exception will now be thrown if a client rejects a response for an EntityEvent.

* Issue **#79** : The client node no longer tries to create directories on the file system for a volume that may be owned by another node.

* Issue **#92** : Error summaries of multiple types no longer overlap each other at the top of the error markers list.

* Issue **#64** : Fixed Hessian serialisation of 'now' which was specified as a ZonedDateTime which cannot be serialised. This field is now a long representing millseconds since epoch.

* Issue **#62** : Task termination button is now enabled.

* Issue **#60** : Fixed validation of stream attributes prior to data upload to prevent null pointer exception.

* Issue **#9** : Created a new implementation of the expression parser that improved expression tokenisation and deals with BODMAS rules properly.

* Issue **#36** : Fixed and vastly improved the configuration of email so that more options can be set allowing for the use of other email services requiring more complex configuration such as gmail.

* Issue **#24** : Header and footer strings are now unescaped so that character sequences such as '\n' are translated into single characters as with standard Java strings, e.g. '\n' will become a new line and '\t' a tab.

* Issue **#40** : Changed Stroom docker conatiner to be based on Alpine linux to save space

* Issue **#40** : Auto import of content packs on Stroom startup and added default content packs into the docker build for Stroom.

* Issue **#30** : Entering stepping mode was prompting for the pipeline to step with but also auto selecting a pipeline at the same time and entering stepping immediately.

* Dashboard auto refresh is now limited to a minimum interval of 10 seconds.

* Issue **#31** : Pipeline stepping was not including user changes immediately as parsers and XSLT filters were using cached content when they should have been ignoring the cache in stepping mode.

* Issue **#27** : Stroom now listens to window closing events and asks the user if they really want to leave the page. This replaces the previous crude attempts to block keys that affected the history or forced a browser refresh.

* Issue **#2** : The order of fields in the query editor is now alphabetical.

* Issue **#3** : When a filter is active on a dashboard table column, a filter icon now appears to indicate this.

* Issue **#5** : Replace() and Decode() dashboard table expression functions no longer ignore cells with null values.

* Issue **#7** : Dashboards are now able to query on open.

* Issue **#8** : Dashboards are now able to re-query automatically at fixed intervals.

* Updated GWT to v2.8.0 and Gin to v2.1.2.

* Issue **#12** : Dashboard queries can now evaluate relative date/time expressions such as now(), hour() etc. In addition to this the expressions also allow the addition or subtraction of durations, e.g. now - 5d.

* Issue **#14** : Dashboard query expressions can now be parameterised with any term able to accept a user defined parameter, e.g. ${user}. Once added parameters can be changed for the entire dashboard via a text box at the top of the dashboard screen which will then execute all queries when enter is pressed or it loses focus.

* Issue **#16** : Dashboard table filters can also accept user defined parameters, e.g. ${user}, to perform filtering when a query is executed.

* Fixed missing text presenter in dashboards.

* Issue **#18** : The data dashboard component will now show data relative to the last selected table row (even if there is more than one table component on the dashboard) if the data component has not been configured to listen to row selections for a specific table component.

* Changed table styling to colour alternate rows, add borders between rows and increase vertical padding

* Issue **#22** : Dashboard table columns can now be configured to wrap text via the format options.

* Issue **#28** : Dashboard component dependencies are now listed with the component name plus the component id in brackets rather than just the component id.

* Issue **#202** : Initial release of the new data retention policy functionality.
