* Issue **#100** : Various list of items in stroom now allow multi selection for add/remove purposes.

* Issue **#112** : Removed 'pool' monitoring screen as all pools are now caches of one form or another.

* Issue **#111** : Fixed query favourites and history.

* Issue **#91** : Only CombinedParser was allowing code to be injected during stepping. Now DSParser and XMLFragmentParser support code injection during stepping.

* Issue **#107** : The UI now only shows new pipeline element items on the 'Add' menu that are allowed children of the selected element.

* Issue **#113** : User names are now validated against a regex specified by the 'stroom.security.userNamePattern' property.

* Issue **#116** : Rename is now only possible when a single explorer item is selected.

* Issue **#114** : Fixed selection manager so that the explorer tree does not select items when a node expander is clicked.

* Issue **#65** : Selection lists are now limited to 300px tall and show scrollbars if needed.

* Issue **#50** : Defaults table result fields to use local time without outputting the timezone.

* Issue **#15** : You can now express time zones in dashboard query expressions or just omit a time zone to use the locale of the browser.

* Issue **#49** : Dynamic XSLT selection now works with pipeline stepping.

## [v5.0-beta.9] - 2017-02-01
* Issue **#63** : Entity selection control now shows current entity name even if it has changed since referencing entity was last saved.

* Issue **#70** : You can now select multiple explorer rows with ctrl and shift key modifiers and perform bulk actions such as copy, move, rename and delete.

* Issue **#85** : findDelete() no longer tries to add ORDER BY condition on UPDATE SQL when deleting streams.

* Issue **#89** : Warnings should now be present in processing logs for reference data lookups that don't specify feed or stream type. This was previously throwing a NullPointerException.

* Issue **#90** : Fixed entity selection dialog used outside of drop down selection control.

* Issue **#88** : Pipeline reference edit dialog now correctly selects the current stream type.

* Issue **#77** : Default index volume creation now sets stream status to INACTIVE rather than CLOSED and stream volume creation sets index status to INACTIVE rather than CLOSED.

* Issue **#93** : Fixed code so that the 'Item' menu is now visible.

* Issue **#97** : Index shard partition date range creation has been improved.

* Issue **#94** : Statistics searches now ignore expression terms with null or empty values so that the use of substitution parameters can be optional.

* Issue **#87** : Fixed explorer scrolling to the top by disabling keyboard selection.

* Issue **#104** : 'Query' no longer appears as an item that a user can allow 'create' on for permissions within a folder.

* Issue **#103** : Added 10 years as a supported data retention age.

* Issue **#86** : The stream delete button is now re-enabled when new items are selected for deletion.

* Issue **#81** : No exception will now be thrown if a client rejects a response for an EntityEvent.

* Issue **#79** : The client node no longer tries to create directories on the file system for a volume that may be owned by another node.

* Issue **#92** : Error summaries of multiple types no longer overlap each other at the top of the error markers list.

## [v5.0-beta.8] - 2016-12-21
* Issue **#64** : Fixed Hessian serialisation of 'now' which was specified as a ZonedDateTime which cannot be serialised. This field is now a long representing millseconds since epoch.

* Issue **#62** : Task termination button is now enabled.

* Issue **#60** : Fixed validation of stream attributes prior to data upload to prevent null pointer exception.

## [v5.0-beta.7] - 2016-12-14
* Issue **#9** : Created a new implementation of the expression parser that improved expression tokenisation and deals with BODMAS rules properly.

* Issue **#36** : Fixed and vastly improved the configuration of email so that more options can be set allowing for the use of other email services requiring more complex configuration such as gmail.

* Issue **#24** : Header and footer strings are now unescaped so that character sequences such as '\n' are translated into single characters as with standard Java strings, e.g. '\n' will become a new line and '\t' a tab.

* Issue **#40** : Changed Stroom docker conatiner to be based on Alpine linux to save space

* Issue **#40** : Auto import of content packs on Stroom startup and added default content packs into the docker build for Stroom.

## [v5.0-beta.6] - 2016-11-22
* Issue **#30** : Entering stepping mode was prompting for the pipeline to step with but also auto selecting a pipeline at the same time and entering stepping immediately.

* Dashboard auto refresh is now limited to a minimum interval of 10 seconds.

* Issue **#31** : Pipeline stepping was not including user changes immediately as parsers and XSLT filters were using cached content when they should have been ignoring the cache in stepping mode.

* Issue **#27** : Stroom now listens to window closing events and asks the user if they really want to leave the page. This replaces the previous crude attempts to block keys that affected the history or forced a browser refresh.

## [v5.0-beta.5] - 2016-11-17
* Issue **#2** : The order of fields in the query editor is now alphabetical.

* Issue **#3** : When a filter is active on a dashboard table column, a filter icon now appears to indicate this.

* Issue **#5** : Replace() and Decode() dashboard table expression functions no longer ignore cells with null values.

* Issue **#7** : Dashboards are now able to query on open.

* Issue **#8** : Dashboards are now able to re-query automatically at fixed intervals.

* Updated GWT to v2.8.0 and Gin to v2.1.2.

* Issue **#12** : Dashboard queries can now evaluate relative date/time expressions such as now(), hour() etc. In addition to this the expressions also allow the addition or subtraction of durations, e.g. now - 5d.

* Issue **#14** : Dashboard query expressions can now be parameterised with any term able to accept a user defined parameter, e.g. ${user}. Once added parameters can be changed for the entire dashboard via a text box at the top of the dashboard screen which will then execute all queries when enter is pressed or it loses focus.

* Issue **#16** : Dashboard table filters can also accept user defined parameters, e.g. ${user}, to perform filtering when a query is executed.

* Fixed missing text presenter in dashboards.

* Issue **#18** : The data dashboard component will now show data relative to the last selected table row (even if there is more than one table component on the dashboard) if the data component has not been configured to listen to row selections for a specific table component.

* Changed table styling to colour alternate rows, add borders between rows and increase vertical padding

* Issue **#22** : Dashboard table columns can now be configured to wrap text via the format options.

* Issue **#28** : Dashboard component dependencies are now listed with the component name plus the component id in brackets rather than just the component id.
