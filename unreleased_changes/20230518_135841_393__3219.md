* Issue **#3219** : Change reference data to store its data in multiple stores, with one store per reference feed. This should reduce contention when reference data is being loaded, as the load of a reference stream will now only affect lookups on streams in the same feed (assuming it is configured for writes block reads). As existing reference streams are used, they will be migrated to the new feed specific stores.


```sh

# Issue title: Consider having multiple LMDB envs for reference data
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3219
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
