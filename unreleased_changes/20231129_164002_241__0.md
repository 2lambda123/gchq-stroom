* Add the un-authenticated API method `/api/idpproxy/v1/noauth/fetchClientCredsToken` to effectively proxy for the IDP's token endpoint to obtain an access token using the client credentials flow. The request contains the client credentials and looks like `{ "clientId": "a-client", "clientSecret": "BR9m.....KNQO" }`. The response media type is `text/plain` and contains the access token.


```sh
# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
