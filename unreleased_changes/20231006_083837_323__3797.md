* Issue **#3797** : Fix bug preventing an owner from granting permissions on a document/folder. Change the document permissions screen to show only users that share at least one group with the user changing the permissions. This is to prevent lowly users from seeing all users on the system. Fix problem of ownership being removed from the owner. Fix other issues with the permission changes not reflecting the changes made in the UI.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
