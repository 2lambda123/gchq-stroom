* Issue **#3074** : Fix data retention summary and purge job when condition includes a pipeline. Fix data viewer screen to allow filtering by pipeline. Fix filtering using the `in folder` condition. Add `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `between` conditions to ID fields, e.g. stream ID. **WARNING**: the expression field `Pipeline` has had the following conditions removed; `in`, `in dictionary`, `=`, `contains` and the field `Pipeline Name` has been added with the following conditions; `in`, `in dictionary`, `=`. This may impact processor filters or retention rules that use the `Pipeline` field. See the SQL at https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3074 to find any processor filters using this field with a now un-supported condition. Change the Reference Data searchable data source to support `in`, `in dictionary` and wild carding.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
