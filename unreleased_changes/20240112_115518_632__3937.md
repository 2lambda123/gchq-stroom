* Issue **#3937** : Re-work the API keys screen using GWT rather than React. Change the structure of the API keys from a JSON Web Token to a 'dumb' random string. Add the ability to enable/disable tokens. Change Stroom to store the hash of the API key rather than the key itself. Include a prefix in the API key (which is stored in Stroom) so that users can identify a key they have against the list of keys in Stroom. Legacy API Keys that are _enabled_ will be migrated from the `token` table into the new `apk-key` table. This is mostly so there is visibility of the legacy API keys. As the legacy API keys are JWTs and Stroom was not checking the `token` table for their presence, authentication relies on the JWT being valid and not expired. It is recommended to create new API keys and get users of the legacy API keys to migrate over. The new API keys allow temporary/permanent revocation so are more secure.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
