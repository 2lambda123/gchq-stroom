* Add pre-populated tag filters to View, Dashboard and Pipeline reference loader pipeline tree pickers. E.g. pre-populates the filter with `tag:extraction tag:dynamic` in the View extraction pipeline picker. IMPORTANT: you will need to assign tags to pipelines so that they are visible in the three screens mentioned above. All reference loader pipelines (i.e. those using ``) should be tagged with `reference-loader`. All extraction pipelines (i.e. those using `SearchResultOutputFilter`) should be tagged with `extraction`. All dynamic extraction pipelines (i.e. those using `DynamicSearchResultOutputFilter`) should be tagged with `extraction` and `dynamic`. If you want to disable pre-filtering of pipelines then you can clear these properites: `dashboardPipelineSelectorIncludedTags`, `viewPipelineSelectorIncludedTags` and `referencePipelineSelectorIncludedTags`.


```sh
# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
