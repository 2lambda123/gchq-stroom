* Issue **#4278** : Make document deletion also delete the permission records for that document. Also run migration `V07_04_00_005__Orphaned_Doc_Perms` which will delete all document permissions (in table `doc_permission`) for docs that are not a folder, not the System doc, are not a valid doc (i.e. in the `doc` table) and are not a pipeline filter. Deleted document permission records will first be copied to a backup table `doc_permission_backup_V07_04_00_005`. 


```sh

# Issue title: Deleting a doc doesn't delete the doc_permission records for it

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
