* Issue **#3534** : Improve query help picker: add more detail text, improve styling, fix keyboard navigation, fix missing overloaded functions. Change the help picker to show markdown detail text. Remove single quotes from function snippet arguments as the Ace editor has a nice way to handle quotes. Fix broken help links for functions. Change the dashboard column expression editor to use the new query help menu.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
