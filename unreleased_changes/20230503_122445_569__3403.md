* Issue **#3403** : Remove `restClient` config property from proxy config. In stroom and proxy add `jerseryClients` configuration item outside the `appConfig`/`proxyConfig` sections. `jerseryClients:` supports multiple jersey client configurations keyed by name. Possible keys are `default`, `stroom`, `open_id`, `content_sync`, `feed_status`, `http_post_filter`. If a required name is not found in the config file `default` will be used. If that is not found, a vanilla jersey client configuration will be used. For configuration options see https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/manual/configuration.html#jerseyclient. Relative key/trust store paths will be treated as relative to stroom home.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
