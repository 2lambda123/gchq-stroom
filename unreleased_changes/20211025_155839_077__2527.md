# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
#
# Examples of acceptable entires are:
#
#
# * Issue **1234** : A change with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#1234** : A change with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
