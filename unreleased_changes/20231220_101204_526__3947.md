* Issue **#3947** : Fix owner validation of document permissions when cascading permissions. Now the validation requiring a single owner is only applied to the top level document being edited. Descendant documents may have no owners or multiple owners due to legacy behaviour in stroom. If there is no change to the owner of the top level document then the descendant owners will be ignored. If _Cascade_ is set to _All_ or there is a change to the owner of the top level document and _Cascade_ is set to _Changes Only_ then the top level owner will be made the only owner of all descendants replacing any existing owners. This change also adds a confirmation dialog that shows what changes will be made to descendant documents. See the GitHub issue for examples.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
