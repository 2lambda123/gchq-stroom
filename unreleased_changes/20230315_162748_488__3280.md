* Issue **#3280** : Make orphan file/meta finder jobs drop out if stroom is shutdown. Change orphan meta finder job to user more efficient SQL. Improve logging output from both finders to include start time, duration and any error/interruption. Fix missing feed names in orphan file finder log.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Orphan File Finder task won't terminate on shutdown
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/3280
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
