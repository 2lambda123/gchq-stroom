* Issue **#3412** : Add a filter icon to pipeline elements in the stepper to show which elements have active filters. Change the _Change Filters_ screen to show which of the elements has active filter(s) and to select the element currently selected in the stepper. Add a context menu to the pipeline elements to allow editing/deleting of the step filters.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
