* Issue **#3076** : Change property `proxyConfig.logStream.metaKeys` from a CSV string to a set of strings, config files will need to be changed. Change property `proxyConfig.contentSync.syncFrequency` from a long to a StroomDuration, existing config should still work. Change property `proxyConfig.forwardDestinations.(forwardTimeoutMs|forwardDelayMs)` of type int to `proxyConfig.forwardDestinations.(forwardTimeout|forwardDelay)` of type StroomDuration, existing config should still work if these properties were not set explicitly, else they will need to be renamed. Change default value of `proxyConfig.repository.storingEnabled` to `true`.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
