* Issue **#4007** : Change the Lucene search code so that it will use the Index's default extraction pipeline if there is no extraction set on the dashboard, or in the case of StroomQL, always use the Index's default extraction pipeline as there no way to set a pipeline.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: Query an Index, only `Stored` fields can be `Select`ed
# Issue link:  https://github.com/gchq/stroom/issues/4007
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
