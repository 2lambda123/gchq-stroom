* Issue **#3219** : Change reference loading to use a two stage process to reduce the time the LMDB write transaction is held open for. Change the hashing of string values to be done on bytes rather than on characters which means new loads will not be able to use existing string values as the hashes won't match. This means some duplication of identical strings, but the ones with legacy hashes will eventually be aged out on purge.

# Issue title: Consider having multiple LMDB envs for reference data

# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
