* Issue **#2449** : Reduce the number of REST calls that property filtering in the UI makes.


```sh
# ********************************************************************************
# Issue title: property filtering in the UI is triggering lots of calls to update the config from the DB
# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included in the CHANGELOG.
# Entries should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
#
# Examples of acceptable entires are:
#
#
# * Issue **1234** : A change with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#1234** : A change with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * A change with no associated GitHub issue.
```
