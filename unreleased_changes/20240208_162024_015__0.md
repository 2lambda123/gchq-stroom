* Add support for `<xsl:message>some message</xsl:message>` which will log the message as `ERROR`, which is consistent with the `stroom:log()` function. If the attribute `terminate="yes"` is set, the it will log as `FATAL`, which will stop processing. You can also use a suitably named child element to set the severity, `<xsl:message><info>my message</info></xsl:message>`. Use of `terminate="yes"` trumps any severity set. Previous behaviour was to log to `stdout` and throw an exception if `terminate` is `yes`.


```sh
# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
