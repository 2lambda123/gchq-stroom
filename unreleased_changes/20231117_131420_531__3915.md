* Issue **#3915** : Change how multi-line attribute values (e.g. for `Files`) are written to the .meta/.mf files. Previously they were written as is so resulted in multiple lines in the file for one entry, which breaks parsing of the file. Now multi-line values are comma delimited in the file, so each entry will be on a single line. Existing meta/mf files in the system cannot be changed.

# ********************************************************************************

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
