* Issue **#3136** : Fix the reference data lookup logic that determines if a ref stream contains a given map or not. Fix NPE in `RefDataLookupRequest#toString()`. Change `ReferenceDataResult` to hold message templates to reduce memory use. Change `RefDataStoreHolder` to only add available maps once per ref stream. Reduce memory use of reference data error/warn/info logs. Improve in app logging of lookups.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
