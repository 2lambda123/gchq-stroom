* Issue **#3952** : Fix handling of thread interrupts (e.g. when a ref load is triggered by a search extraction and the search is stopped) during reference data loads. Interrupted ref loads now correctly get a load state of TERMINATED. Stopped searches no longer show a warning triangle with ref errors. Terminated pipeline tasks no longer list errors/warnings for the ref load/lookups.

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
```
