* Issue **#3112** : Change meta key `UploadUser` to `UploadUserId`. Add meta key `UploadUserUsername` to hold the `preferred_username` from the IDP. **NOTE**: the stroom property `receive.requireTokenAuthentication` and proxy property `receivedDataConfig.requireTokenAuthentication` have both been replaced by `tokenAuthenticationEnabled`, `certificateAuthenticationEnabled` and `authenticationRequired`, allowing authentication to be disabled and the mechanism to be controlled on data receipt. Remove properties `receive.unknownClassification` and `receive.feedNamePattern` as they are unused and duplicates of other properties. Replace property `security.authentication.useInternal` (boolean) with `security.authentication.identityProviderType` (`INTERNAL`|`EXTERNAL`|`TEST`).

# ONLY the top line will be included as a change entry in the CHANGELOG.
# The entry should be in GitHub flavour markdown and should be written on a SINGLE
# line with no hard breaks. You can have multiple change files for a single GitHub issue.
# The  entry should be written in the imperative mood, i.e. 'Fix nasty bug' rather than
# 'Fixed nasty bug'.
#
# Examples of acceptable entries are:
#
#
# * Issue **123** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in this repository
#
# * Issue **namespace/other-repo#456** : Fix bug with an associated GitHub issue in another repository
#
# * Fix bug with no associated GitHub issue.
